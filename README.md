Retribution
===========

You are an errant knight, traveling the land. Your family was once a great and wealthy noble family in a faraway land until your grandfather was murdered in a most unnatural way (by poison put in through the ear - like in Hamlet) and your family was shamed because of it and a great deal of your wealth was taken away by an evil usurper (your father claims to have seen that he was the murderer of your grandfather). You must travel around, seeking enough evidence against this usurper to prove that he was the murderer before his spies can assassinate you! A twist awaits you in the end. :)
